<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>You just have to avoid outgoing SMTP to go through exim to use sendgrid or similar SMTP services to send your emails. There’s a tweak settings page in WHM from where you turn off this option.</p>
<p>Learn how to use telnet and monitor exim logs to debug your email related problems.</p>
<hr>
<p>People complained that they are not receiving emails in their hotmail account from their site, while emails are coming to their gmail and yahoo account. Upon quick inspection i see that exim logs those rejection.</p>
<p>I created a simple script <code>testmail.php</code> to test the hotmail rejection.</p>
<pre class="php"><code>if($argv[1] == &quot;testhotmail&quot;) {
  $to = &quot;a@hotmail.com&quot;;
} else {
  $to = &quot;a@yipl.com.np&quot;;
}
$subject = &quot;This is subject&quot;;
$message = &quot;This is simple text message.&quot;;
$header = &quot;From:info@abc.com \r\n&quot;;
$retval = mail ($to,$subject,$message,$header);
if( $retval == true ) {
  echo &quot;Message sent successfully...&quot;;
}
else {
  echo &quot;Message could not be sent...&quot;;
}</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>php testmail.php</code> to send email to other domain than hotmail, results in the following message in <code>\var\log\exim_mainlog</code> file and i got the message in the spam. Here spam is not important, delivery is.</p>

<p>After spending an hour in the server and searching in the forums, i decided to use <a href="http://sendgrid.com">sendgrid</a> to send emails through external SMTP. I tested their <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php">sendgrid-api</a> and I was able to receive the emails in my inbox. Direct use of SMTP server wasnot working.</p>
<p>I telnet to the sendgrid smtp and got incorrect authentication data. Please see the <a href="https://www.ndchost.com/wiki/mail/test-smtp-auth-telnet">steps here</a> to telnet to SMTP server.</p>

<p>Different forums gave different solutions. One was to implement sendgrid directly in exim. I followed the instructions, made changes in exim configuration and yet i was still getting <code>dovecot_login authenticator failed</code>. I couldn’t find the way to get <code>sendgrid_login authenticator</code> working. I would still like to see how to get the sendgrid_login do the authentication.</p>
<p>Finally i landed on this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14297264/password-not-accepted-from-server-535-incorrect-authentication-data-when-send">stackoverflow page</a> and i turned off the option to restrict outgoing SMTP to exim.</p>

<p>Finally the authentication worked and the emails are sent via sendgrid.</p>

<p>I spent close to 4 hours to get the email pass through sendgrid SMTP. It was just an option you need to check off. Sigh.</p>
