#### Ran 27K Ultra Trail Race at Shivapuri

Jan 14. I couldn't walk properly for the next 7 days. 27KM in [4hr 38min](http://ultratrailkathmandu.com/kathmandu-5050/2014-results/). Couldn't be proud more.

#### Stripe: Captured the Flag

Aug 29. Still remember the night when I completed the final step few minutes before the deadline. I am still proudly wearing that tshirt. The [problems](https://github.com/stripe-ctf/stripe-ctf-2.0) were amazingly interesting and challenging.

## Somewhere between 2003 and 2004

#### Sold my first software

I don't remember the dates. Lost everything when I unknowingly formatted my hard disk while tinkering with linux. Developed the application in Visual C++ and MS Access to manage the staff CV. The mere NRs. 5000 was more than just the money.
